## Daiyunshan (戴云山)

Daiyun Mountain National Nature Reserve (25°38′07″~25°43′40″N, 118°05′22″~110°20′15″E) is located in Dehua County, Fujian Province, China. The highest peak of the mountain has a maximum elevation of 1856 m. The total area of the reserve is 134.72 km2. The study site has a southern subtropical and mid-subtropical climate with an average annual temperature of 15.6–19.5◦C. The extreme minimum temperature is 16.8°C, and extreme maximum temperature is 36.6°C. The average annual precipitation is about 1700–2000 mm, along with average annual relative humidity of 80%.

### **Vegetation**

The typical vegetation types are coniferous and evergreen broad-leaved forest. With the increase of elevation, the vertical band spectrum appears as follows: evergreen broad-leaved forest (650-1000 m), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (1000-1200 m), temperate coniferous forest (1200-1650 m), mossy dwarf spring forest (1650-1765 m) and meadow (above 1750 m).

### **Flora**

The vegetation arbor layer of the Daiyunshan Mountains is mainly composed of *Pinus taiwanensis*, *Clethra cavaleriei*, and *Rhododendron farrerae*, etc. The shrub layer mainly includes *Eurya saxicola*, *E. rubiginosa* and *Ilex crenata*, etc. The herbaceous layer mainly includes *Diplopterygium glaucum*, *Woodwardia japonica*, and *Lophatherum gracile*, etc. The *P. taiwanensis* is the most representative plant in Daiyun Mountain. The Daiyun Mountain has the best-preserved virgin *P. taiwanensis* forest community of more than 6 000 hm2 in mainland China, which mainly distributed at elevation of 1000-1800 m.

### **Research sites of BEST network**

In order to reduce the impact of human disturbance, the elevation gradients of Daiyun Mountain were set ranging from 900 m to 1600 m with the interval of 100 m. Eight permanent sample plots were set along elevation gradients in Daiyun Mountain. Each elevation set one a sample plot of 20 m ×30 m, and each plot was divided into three quadrat of 10 m ×20 m. The sample plots were selected from a representative forest community. Slope, aspect and other topographic factors of each plot were also measured by compass and iButton. All species with DBH above 1 cm in the plot were labeled and investigated, and species name, diameter and height were also recorded.
