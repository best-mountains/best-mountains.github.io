## Mt. Nanling (南岭)

Nanling is located in the Nanling National Nature Reserve (112º30′-113º04′E, 24º37′-24º57′N), a central part of Nanling mountains and establishing Nanling National Park, of China. It has a mid-subtropical monsoon climate, with sufficient heat, abundant rainfall, and high humidity. It has an average annual temperature of 17.7 ℃, an average annual precipitation of 1705 mm, and an average relative humidity of 84%.

### **Research sites of BEST network**

In 2020-2024, 78 20 m × 20 m plots were set up along an elevational gradient from 600 m to 1800 m, with six plots per 100 m. Within each plot, all wood stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species. There were 15880 individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 276 species from 129 genera and 61 families.
In 2020, one 400 m × 500 m plot was set up from 1008 m to 1254 m (The Nanling 20-ha Forest dynamics Plot). All wood stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species within the plot. There were 132905 individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 229 species from 127 genera and 63 families.
