## Mt. Guanshan (江西官山)

Mt. Guan is located in the northwest of Jiangxi Province. A majority of the mountain is located within the Mt. Guan National Nature Reserve (28°30'-28°40'N, 114°29'-114°45'E), and has a total area of 115 km2. The mountain peak is at 1480 m a.s.l. This region is mainly influenced by the Pacific monsoon climate, with mean annual temperature 11℃ to 16.2℃, and annual precipitation ranging from 1950 mm to 2100 mm.

### **Vegetation**

Due to the steep terrain and drastically climatic variations along elevation, Mt. Guan has an obvious vertical distribution zone of vegetations, including evergreen broad-leaved forest, evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mix forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, and scrublands.

### **Research sites of BEST network**

In 2016-2018, twelve 20 m × 20 m plots along an elevational gradient were set up from 290 m to 1370 m above the sea level in this mountain. The plots were set at intervals of \~100 m in elevation. Within each plot, all woody stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species. There were 4073 individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 53 families, 104 genera and 233 species.

In 2020, four 2 m × 2 m seedling plots were set up in every elevational plot. There were 176 species recorded, belonging to 65 families and 111 genera.
