# Why Mountains in China?

[![](Pictures/Mountains_China.png)](Pictures/Mountains_China.png)

<br>

*China harbours over 35,000 higher plant species, and over 2,700 terrestrial vertebrate species, with a high proportion of endemic species. In general, biodiversity in China is much higher than in any other country covering similar latitudes. Among the 36 global biodiversity hotspots, the "Mountains of Southwest China" hotspot lies almost entirely (\> 98% in area), and the "Himalaya" (33%), "Mountains of Central Asia" (29%), and "Indo-Burma" (15%) hotspots lie partly within China.*

# About the BEST

Inspired by the early works in elevational gradients, we initialed a regional research network **BEST** (**B**iodiversity along **E**levational gradients: **S**hifts and **T**ransitions) in 2017, to monitor long-term biodiversity dynamics of multiple taxa (e.g., vascular plants, mosses, soil microbes, and birds) under climate change and land use. Microclimates (temperature and moisture of air and soil) are measured and served as one key element to understand community dynamics across space and time. Some new technologies, such as drones and bioacoustic audio recorders, also plan to use for the monitoring. By collaborating with over 15 research teams with different backgrounds, we have set up 15
elevational transects across a large research area mainly in subtropical and tropical forest region of China.
