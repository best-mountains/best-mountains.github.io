## Mt. Yulong (云南玉龙雪山)

Mt. Yulong (27°10′–27°40′N, 100°09′–100°20′E) , also named as Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, is located in the northwest of Yunnan province, China. It is located the southeast of the Hengduan Mountains and has a total area of 260 km2. The mountain peak is at 5596 m a.s.l., and it is the southernmost glacierized area in North Hemisphere which is extremely sensitive to climate change. The weather is monsoon climate which include a dry season from November to May and a rainy season from June to October. The mean annual temperature at Yulong Mountain is 12.8°C, and the average annual precipitation is 935 mm.

### **Vegetation**

Five distinct vegetation types were observed along elevations in our study region. *Pinus armandii* forest (2600- 2800 m); *Pinus armandii*, *Pinus yunnanensis* and *Quercus spinosa* mixed forest (2800-3000 m); *Pinus yunnanensis* and *Quercus guyavifolia* mixed forest (3000-3500m); *Quercus aquifolioides* forest (3500-3700m); and *Quercus aquifolioides*, *Abies georgei* and Rhododendron forest (3700-3900 m).

### **Flora**

In Yulong mountains, a total of 2028 native seed plant species from 625 genera and 136 families. More than half of the species are herbaceous (66.4 %; 82 families; 426 genera; and 1346 species), and 33.6 % are woody species (290 tree species from 120 genera and 56 families, and 392 shrub species from 133 genera and 62 families; Wang et al. 2007).

### **Research sites of BEST network**

In 2013-2014, Nineteen 20 m × 50 m plots along an elevational gradient were set up from 2650 m to 3850 m above the sea level in this mountain. The plots were set based on the distinct vegetation types. Within each plot, all woody stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species. There were individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 22 families, 46 genera and 59 species. Meanwhile, a total of 101 shrub species and 201 herbaceous species were observed in our study plots.
