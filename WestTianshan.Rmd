West Tianshan National Nature Reserve (43°03′～43°15’N, 82°51′～83°06′E) and Wild Walnut Vally Provincial Nature Reserve. The total area of Mt. West Tianshan National Nature Reserve is 31217 km2, and the mountain peak is at 4257 m a.s.l. This region is mainly influenced by the temperate semiarid continental climate, with mean annual temperature varying from 5℃ to 7℃, and annual precipitation ranging from 600 mm to 800 mm.

### **Vegetation**

Mt. West Tianshan has an obvious vertical distribution zone of vegetations, including desert vegetation (<1100m), Malus sieversii and Armeniaca vulgaris mixed forest (1100-1300m), Populus talassica and Picea schrenkiana mixed forest (1300-1500m), Picea schrenkiana forest (1500-2950m), snow line (ca. 3200m), alpine meadow and flowstone lands (2590-3500 m), and permanent snow and glacier zone (>3500 m). This mountain is well known for a large number of endangered or endemic plants, such as *Malus sieversii*, *Armeniaca vulgaris*, *Saussurea involucrate*, *Helianthemum songaricum*, and *Picea schrenkiana var. tianshanica*.

### **Research sites of BEST network**

In 2019, thirteen 20 m × 20 m plots along an elevational gradient were set up from 1200 m to 2800 m in West Tianshan National Nature Reserve. The plots were set at intervals of ~100 m in elevation. Within each plot, all woody stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species. There were 981 individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 4 families, 7 genera and 8 species.
