## Mt. Bawangling (海南霸王岭)

Bawangling is located in Hainan Island, South China (18°52′-19°12′ N, 108°53′-109°20′ E). Bawangling covers one of the largest areas of tropical rain forests in China. It is ca. 500 km2 with an elevation range of ca. 100–1654 m a.s.l. The mean annual air temperature varies from 23.6°C (ca. 100 m a.s.l.) to 16.7°C (ca. 1400 m a.s.l.). The precipitation is seasonal distributed, with a rainy season between May to October and a dry season between November to April.

### **Vegetation**

Topographic and climatic variations in Bawangling result in a vertical zonation of major forest types. The vegetation types in the Bawangling region from low to high altitudes are deciduous monsoon forest (0- 500 m a.s.l.), tropical lowland rain forest (0–700 m a.s.l), tropical conifers forest (500–700 m a.s.l), tropical montane rain forest (800–1300 m a.s.l), tropical montane evergreen forest (1200–1400 m a.s.l) and tropical dwarf forest (above 1300 m a.s.l).

### **Research sites of BEST network**

The elevational transect of our study spans ~1,200 m in elevation from 265 to 1,400 m and consists of 12 sites, each with a 20×20m permanent sampling plot, all in old growth forest. Within each plot, all woody stems with ≥ 1 cm DBH were tagged and identified to species. There were 4249 individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm recorded, belonging to 369 woody plant species.
